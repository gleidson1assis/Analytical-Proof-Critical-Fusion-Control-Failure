THE ANALYTICAL PROOF OF FUNDAMENTAL FAILURE IN HIGH-Q PLASMA CONTROL ARCHITECTURE
​Abstract: The Critical Timescale Requirement
​This document details an analytical proof that conclusively demonstrates the scientific unviability of the current Tokamak control paradigm for sustaining high-Q plasma. The analysis exposes a logical failure rooted in the incompatibility between the system's architecture and the fundamental physics of plasma instabilities.
​The work identifies a critical fault in the systems architecture and establishes a new and rigorous timescale requirement for achieving plasma stability. This requirement is shown to be incompatible with existing control hardware and software implementations currently utilized in major fusion projects (ITER, PPPL, etc.).
​This finding requires immediate global attention due to its direct financial implications for billions of dollars in public funding dedicated to fusion energy research.
